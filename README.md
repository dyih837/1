# 40Hz-AMSAD
MIT's Professor Li-Huei Tsai and her team found that 40Hz audio-visual stimulation has a good therapeutic effect on Alzheimer's mice.

I believes that the root cause of Alzheimer's is the lack of deep sleep. Based on Professor Cai Lihui's research, I designed a 40Hz weak magnetic sleep aid device.

The key to PCB design is the coil that is roughly the size of a pillow.

The microcontroller chosen is CH32V003J4M6, which I happen to have on hand, as it is also used in another project, and it is also small in size and affordable.

The power amplifier chosen is LTK5128D, which is widely used and affordable, with both AB mode and D mode. After testing, it was found that the AB mode has a better effect.

Personal feeling on the sleep aid effect:
35Hz > 40Hz > 45Hz > 30Hz > 7.8Hz > 0.5Hz

Below 30Hz, there is basically no sleep aid effect and it can even affect falling asleep. Above 30Hz, there is a more obvious sleep aid effect.

MIT蔡立慧教师团队发现在40Hz的声光刺激下，对阿尔兹海默小鼠有很好的治愈效果。

我认为阿尔兹海默的原因在于没有很好的深度睡眠。 我在蔡立慧教授研究基础上设计了40Hz的弱磁助眠设备。

设计的关键是和枕头大致大小的线圈。
单片机选用CH32V003J4M6，手边正好有，另外一个项目用到，另外就是体积小，便宜。
功放选用LTK5128D，便宜用得广泛，有AB模式和D模式，测试后发现AB模式效果更好。

个人感觉助眠效果：
35Hz > 40Hz > 45Hz > 30Hz > 7.8Hz > 0.5Hz
低于30Hz基本没有助眠效果，还会影响入睡。30Hz以上有比较明显的助眠效果。
