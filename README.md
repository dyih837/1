# 40Hz-AMSAD
MIT's Professor Cai Lihui and her team found that 40Hz audio-visual stimulation has a good therapeutic effect on Alzheimer's mice. I believes that the root cause of Alzheimer's is the lack of deep sleep. Based on Professor Cai Lihui's research, I designed a 40Hz weak magnetic sleep aid device.
